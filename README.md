# Seat-Heater-Control-System
•	Developed a real-time seat heater control system for automotive applications using FreeRTOS on Tiva C microcontrollers.
•	Designed a control system with multiple tasks managing the driver and passenger seat heaters, demonstrating proficiency in real-time task management.
•	Integrated GPIO, UART, ADC, and GPTM modules as part of the MCAL layer, showcasing skills in microcontroller interfacing.
•	Used edge-triggered interrupts for responsiveness, and implemented diagnostics for sensor failure.
•	Handled shared resources using mutexes and optimized system performance through event     flags and semaphores, emphasizing knowledge in concurrency control and resource management.
